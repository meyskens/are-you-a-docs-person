Are you a docs person?
======================

This is a small project inspired by an idea of [Carolyn Van Slyck](https://github.com/carolynvs) to calculate the amount of documentation contributions vs documentation contributions you have done on GitHub.
This project makes use of [gitbase](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase) to query the repositories and [Babelfish](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd) to filter any in code comments (eg. GoDoc).
